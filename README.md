# Summary of the Project 

The objective of this project is to analyze and cluster a dataset related to Netflix. **The aim is to explore patterns and similarities among the content available on the platform and group them into meaningful clusters.**

The dataset will be preprocessed by handling the missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations. Features enginerring techniques may also be applied to extract useful information from the existing attributes.

Data analysis techniques will be utilized to gain insights into the dataset. **Visualizations and statistical summaries will be used to understand the distribution of variables.**

Once the dataset has been throughly analyzed, clustering algroithms will be employed. These algorithms will group similar Netflix shows and Movies together based on their attributes. **The optimal number of clusters will be determined using technique like the elbow method.**

# Conclusion

1- It is interesting to note that the majority of the content available on Netflix consists of movies. However, in recent years, the platform has been focusing more on TV shows.

2- Most of these shows are released either at the end or the beginning of the year.

3- The United States and India are among the top five countries that produce all of the available content on the platform. Additionally, out of the top ten actors with the maximum content, six of them are from India.

4- When it comes to content ratings, TV-MA tops the charts, indicating that mature content is more popular on Netflix.
